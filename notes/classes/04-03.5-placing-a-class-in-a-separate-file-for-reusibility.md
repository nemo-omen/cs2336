# Placing a class in a separate file for reusibility

One of the benefits of creating class definitions is that, when packaged properly, our classes can be reused by other programmers.

- The compiler creates __only one__ copy of the class's member functions and shares that copy across all the class's objects
- Each object needs its own data members (because its contents can vary across objects)
- member function code is __not modifiable__, so it can be shared among all objects of a class
- therefore, the size of an object depends on the amount of memory required to store that class's data members
- by including `GradeBook.h` (below), we give the compiler the information it needs to determine the size of a `GradeBook` object and to determine if the objects are used correctly.
- placing a class definition in a `header` file reveals the entire implementation of a class to the class's clients.
- to use an object of a class, the client code only needs to know what member functions to call, what arguments to provide to each member function, and what return type to expect from each member function.
  - the client code does not need to know how those functions are implemented
- if the client code _does_ know how a class is implemented, the client-code programmer might write client code based on the class's implementation details.
- ideally, if that implementation changes, the class's clients should not have to change
- hiding the class's implementation details makes it easier to change the class's implementation while minimizing, and hopefully eliminating, changes to client code.



Define classes in a `header` file so they can be included in a `cpp` file.

```cpp
// GradeBook.h

#include<iostream>
#include<string>

// notice we're not specifying a namespace

class GradeBook {
  public:
  // constructor initializes courseName with a string supplied as argument
    explicit GradeBook(std::string name)
      : courseName ( name ) {
        // empty body
    }

    void setCourseName(std::string name) {
      courseName = name;
    }

    std::string getCourseName() const {
      return courseName;
    }

    coid displayMessage() const {
      std::cout << "Welcome to the gradebook for\n" << getCourseName() << "!" << std::endl;
    }

  private:
    sd::string courseName;
}

```

```cpp
// main.cpp

#include<iostream>
#include "GradeBook.h" // include the class definition
using namespace std;

int main () {
  GradeBook gb1("CS101 Introduction to C++ Programming");
  GradeBook gb2("CS102 Data Structures in C++");

  cout 
    << "Grade book 1 created for course: "
    << gb1.getCourseName() 
    << "\nGrade book 2 created for course: "
    << gb2.getCourseName
    << endl;
}
```
