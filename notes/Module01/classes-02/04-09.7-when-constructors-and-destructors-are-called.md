# When constructors and destructors are called

- both called implicitly
- the order in which these function calls occur depends on the order in which execution enters and leaves the scope where the objects are instantiated
- generally, destructor calls are made in the reverse order of the corresponding constructor calls
  - the storage classes of objects can alter the order in which destructors are called

- constructors are called for objs defined on the global scope _before_ any other function (including `main`) begins execution
  - order of glob. obj. constructors between files is not guaranteed
  - corresponding destructors are called when `main` terminates
- function `exit` forces a prog. to terminate immediately and does not exec. the destructors of local objs
- function `abort` performs similarly to `exit` but forces the prog. to terminate _immediately_, without allowing the destructors of any objects to be called
- __local__ constructors and destructors (those for local objects) are called __each time__ execution enters and leaves the scope
- __local__ destructors are not called if the program terminates with a call to `exit` or `abort`
- constructor for a __static local__ obj is called _only once_, when execution first reaches the point where the obj is defined -- the corresponding destructor is called when `main` terminates or when `exit` is called
- global and __static__ objects are destroyed in the reverse order of their creation -- __FILO__
- destructors for __static__ objects arenot called if the prog terminates with call to `abort`

#### Definition
```cpp
// CreateAndDestroy.h

#include <string>
using namespace std;

#ifndef CREATE_H
#define CREATE_H
class CreateAndDestroy {
  public:
    CreateAndDestroy();   // constructor
    ~CreateAndDestroy();  // destructor
  private:
    int objectID;         // ID number for object
    string message;       // message describing object
};

#endif
```

#### Implementation

```cpp
// constructor sets obj's ID and message
CreateAndDestroy::CreateAndDestroy(int ID, string messageString)
  : objectID(ID), message(messageSring) {
    cout << "Object" << objectID << " constructor runs " << message << endl;
}

// destructor
CreateAndDestroy::~CreateAndDestroy() {
  cout << ( ObjectID == 1 || objectID == 6 ? "\n" : "" );

  cout << "Object " objectID << " destructor runs " << message << endl;
}
```
