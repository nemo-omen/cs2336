# Destructors

__The name__ of the _destructor_ for a class is the tilde character, `~` followed by the class name.

- called implicitly when an obj is destroyed
- Destructor itself doesn't release the obj's mem. - it performs __termination housekeeping__ before the object's memory is reclaimed so the mem may be used to hold more objs
- no params, no return value
- may not return a specific type, not even `void`
- a class has __one destructor__
- destructor __must be `public`__
- if you don't explicitly define a destructor, the compiler defines an empty destructor
